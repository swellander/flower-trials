Sudoku Checker
Sudoku is a game where players must fill in a 9 x 9 board with the numbers 1 through 9. Each row and column must have each number from 1 through 9 with no repeats.

Create an application that checks if a completed Sudoku puzzle is “legal.” In other words, it should ensure that each row and each column have all numbers from 1 to 9 with no repeats. Focus on the business logic and make sure to test the logic thoroughly before implementing any user interface logic.
